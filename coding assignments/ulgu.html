            <p>Ulgu is the Grey Wind of Magic, fueling the Lore of Shadows.  It embodies obfuscation, uncertainty, and planning.  It swells like great fog banks in places where people plot and scheme, both for good and evil.  Cities, especially, are drenched Ulgu; so many people, each with their own plans, draw the grey wind like a magnet.</p>
            <p>The Shadowmancers who practice this lore embody this secretiveness.  They are spies without peer, able to travel unseen and observe whatever they or their lords desire.  Ulgu is unsurprisingly drawn to misty and foggy weather, the thicker and denser the better.</p>
            <p>In Grand Cathay, Ulgu is known as the Elemental Wind of Darkness.  It is Yin-aligned, favored by the Moon Empress, and associated with one of the lost dragons.</p>
