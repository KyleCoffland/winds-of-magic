            <p>Ghur is the Brown Wind of Magic, used to fuel the Lore of Beasts.  It is wild and savage, embodied by bestial and wild animals and untamed wilderness.  It is a thin, chill breeze that cuts through any sort of protection, like the tooth and claw of a predator.  It is utterly devoid of malice, and truly inhuman in the sensations and emotions it encourages.</p>
            <p>The Amber Wind is drawn to wild places, where animals roam and hunt with no human interference.  Its practitioners, shamans, are half-wild themselves, and often wear untreated animal pelts and horns to help draw in the wind of Ghur.  Heavy rainfall also draws the Amber Wind, and makes the casting of spells from the Lore of Beasts easier.</p>
            <p>In Grand Cathay, Ghur is known as the Elemental Wind of Wood.  It is Yin-aligned, and strongly associated with the Sea Dragon Yin-Yin.</p>
