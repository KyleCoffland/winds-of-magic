        <p>Aqshy is the Red Wind of Magic, used to fuel the Lore of Fire.  It is a passionate and direct wind, enflaming and being fueled by intense emotions.  Of all the winds it is the most direct and straight-forward, with most spells devoted to combat.</p>
        <p>A hot and pervasive wind, it is one of the most prevalent and the pyromancers who practice it can be found in many realms.  It is not exclusively used as a weapon; just as fire can remove impurities in rock and metal, so too can spells of Aqshy cleanse poisons and purify the body.  It is unsurprisingly drawn to hot weather and especially droughts.</p>
        <p>In Grand Cathay, Aqshy is known as the Elemental Wind of Fire.  It is considered Yang-aligned, and associated with the Fire Dragon Li Dao.</p>
