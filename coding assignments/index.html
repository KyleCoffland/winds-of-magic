    <!--First text segment-->
    <p>Magic is a deeply integral and important facet of the Warhammer setting, such that when the setting was remade into Age of Sigmar, the Winds of Magic became the literal foundation of the world itself.  This website will provide an examination of this element of the setting.</p>

    <h2 class="medtitle">Magic and Chaos</h2>
    <p>Magic is inextricably linked to Chaos, the otherworldly destructive forces which threaten every aspect of the world.  This is why many civilizations and societies shun magic, with the mighty Empire of Sigmar outlawing the practice for almost all of its history.  The power and utility which magic provides cannot be denied, however, and against the forces of Chaos, it is a weapon as indispensable as it is dangerous.</p>

    <h2 class="medtitle">The Winds of Magic</h2>
    <p>Just as air moves throughout the world in the form of wind, so too do magical energies flow across the world in predictable patterns and currents.  These currents are referred to as winds.  At each of the planetâ€™s poles are massive wounds in reality, gateways into the nightmarish Realms of Chaos.  The otherworldly energies of Chaos flow through these gates and into the material world, and these are magical energies.  Upon entering the world, the raw magical energy splits into eight distinct currents; these are the Winds of Magic.</p>
    <p>If left unchecked, the world would become so saturated with magical energy that it would effectively be absorbed into Realms of Chaos.  To prevent this, the Elves in ancient times wove a Great Vortex into being which draws magical energy from across the planet and grounds it, keeping magical energy at a safe level.  Of course, that this also empowers Elven magic was considered a fortunate by-product.</p>
