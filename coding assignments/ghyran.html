        <p>Ghyran is the Green Wind of Magic, fueling the Lore of Life.  It is a cool, nurturing wind that encourages growth and fertility, especially among plants and vegetation.  It is, in its own way, the most prevalent of the winds, playing a major role in the life cycles of the world and the creatures and plants which live there.</p>
        <p>The green wind flows like water, and is among the easier winds to channel and utilize.  The Druids who practice it are therefore quite numerous as wizards go, and their influence on crop growth makes them more popular than those of other lores.  Ghyran is drawn to rain, particularly gentle, light rains.</p>
        <p>In Grand Cathay, Ghyran is known as the Elemental Wind of Water.  It is Yang-aligned, and associated with the Storm Dragon Miao Ying.</p>
