            <p>Azyr is the Blue Wind of Magic, used to fuel the Lore of the Heavens.  It is a wind of dual nature, at once placid and dreamy yet turning energized and sharp in an instant.  The sudden fall of lightning, the “bolt from the blue”, is emblematic of this wind.  But it is also the wind of dreams, prophecy, and contemplation of the future.</p>
            <p>A high and diffuse wind, it is among the more difficult to wield effectively.  It is drawn to high open places, especially mountain peaks, and clear open skies.  Many astromancers are also astronomers, and establish observatories in lofty places and locals.</p>
            <p>In Grand Cathay, Azyr is known as the Elemental Wind of Stone.  It is Yang-aligned, associated with Yuan Bo the Jade Dragon, and highly favored by the Celestial Dragon Emperor.</p>
