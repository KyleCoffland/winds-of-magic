            <p>Hysh is the White Wind of Magic, fueling the Lore of Light.  It is a lofty and diffuse wind, easily the most difficult to channel into spells.  Embodying philosophy, reason, and thought itself, Hysh is also an incredibly potent weapon against the nightmares which come from Chaos.  Indeed, the sealing and banishment of these otherworldly creatures is paramount.</p>
            <p>The Lore of Light is a notoriously challenging lore.  Its practitioners, the Hierophants, will often have entire choirs of apprentices creating just the right harmony for their spellcraft.  Hysh is drawn to clear, open skies and sunny days.</p>
            <p>In Grand Cathay, Hysh is known as the Elemental Wind of Light.  It is Yang-aligned, and associated with the missing dragon Shen Zoo.</p>
