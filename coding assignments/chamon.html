            <p>Chamon is the Yellow Wind of Magic, fuelling the Lore of Metal.  It is a dense, heavy wind, drawn to dense materials such as metals.  It is the wind of logic and process, the step-by-step methods of action.  It shares much in common with mundane chemistry.</p>
            <p>Alchemists, those who practice this lore, are as much scientists and engineers as wizards, utilizing careful, repetitive processes to expand their knowledge.  They are also foremost experts in artiface, the crafting of magical artefacts and items.  Chamon is drawn to dry weather, especially cold.  The current head of the Imperial Colleges of Magic is a practitioner of this lore.</p>
            <p>In Grand Cathay, Chamon is known as the Elemental Wind of Iron.  It is Yin-aligned, and associated with the Iron Dragon Zhao Ming.</p>
